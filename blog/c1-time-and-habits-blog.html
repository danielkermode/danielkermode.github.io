      <p>The first couple of links talked about meditation and mindfulness. Meditation doesn't seem
      that interesting for me, a few of the links were too pseudosciencey for my liking and although it
      may be useful for many people, it doesn't tend to work for me. One of the lines stood out:
      <br/>
      <blockquote class='alert alert-info'><p>Many people will tell you that allowing time and space to listen to your emotions, listen to your heart and just be mindful is either a waste of time or somehow ‘hippy psychobabble’.</p>
      <footer>Many People</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I concur.</p>
      <p>The Pomodoro Technique I have come across before. The video is nice and catchy, but I'll be honest:
      I can't really understand exactly how it all works. I also don't own a tomato timer, so I think that this method may not be ideal for me.
      </p>
      <p>The article 'Making it big by starting small' I really liked, and found that a lot of it <i>resonated</i> with me. Small, incremental
      steps is how I ever accomplish anything.</p>
      <p>The video on habits also <i>resonated</i> with me. Chocolate sounds like a great motivator to get me to go to the gym, even if there is
      a slight canceling effect that occurs when the chocolate is consumed. It also presented the idea of small increments to build the foundations
      for a longer-lasting habit. It suggested that practice is not necessarily always fun; sometimes if you want to achieve
      a desired result, you must bite the bullet and do the hard yards. Of course, how hard the yards are will differ from person to person,
      and this idea was also suggested in the video with the notion that there are morning people and night people, which <i>resonated</i> with me
       because I am certainly not a morning person.</p>

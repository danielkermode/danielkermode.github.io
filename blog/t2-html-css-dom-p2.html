        <b>Grid-Based Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Grids are a structure used in any sort of graphic design. They provide a framework to the designer that allows easy, logical organisation of graphical elements that need to be shown. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap </a> is an example of a framework that uses a grid system to allow webpage elements to be organised in such a way. In Bootstrap, there are 12 different column classes that can be used for HTML elements, each dividing the page into a section. 12 is a great number for a web page grid, because it means the page can be divided into thirds, quarters or halves and the columns are wide enough that the user can see what's going on in each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
      This page uses Bootstrap through a CDN (content delivery network) to access Bootstrap classes within HTML elements.

        <b>Responsive Web Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>
      From the trustworthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Wikipedia</a>, Responsive Web Design&trade; (not actually trademarked) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience. This is "hypey" because currently a large number of people are viewing the web through not only computers, but also devices such as iPhone&trade;s and iPad&trade;s (actually trademarked). A site designed with RWD is fluid and can be resized proportionally across different size screens without ruining the overall structure of the page. This makes life far easier for the developer, who can easily make sites that look great across a range of devices, and also for the viewer, who is delighted to see such a great looking webpage even on his or her iPhone&trade;.
      </p>
      <p>
      In technical terms, this is done through a number of methods. For example:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item my-li">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
        By using percentage units instead of absolute pixels
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item my-li">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span>
        By using media queries in CSS which allow custom style rules based on the characteristics of the device
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Responsive web design is becoming more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.
      </p>

      <b>Take on the EDA experience:</b>
      <br/>
      <p>I like the idea that the process is evolutionary, and that people can take
      what they want out of the course. I see individuality as very important when it comes
      to learning new skills, and for most things. The remote part of the course is a great way
      to express individual learning preferences, since no one is watching you! It does tend to
      throw you in the deep end, but this isn't bad because it's practice for life in general.</p>
      <p>I won't know how I engage with the culture until I experience it, but I see
      myself as reacting positively to the freedom given. I also like the idea of a relatively shorter program
      since it forces you to focus and really delve into the content.</p>
      <p>I'm excited to participate in this learning style. The only worries I have regarding the remote
      style is problems with the time zone (since I'm in Europe at the moment) and harder communication
      for some things that just aren't possible to do on your own (waffle permissions is one I've come across
      already!)</p>
